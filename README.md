# Project Neumann
Project Neumann is a RISC-V based microcontroller system using the [PULPino] core from the [PULP] platform with an 12-bit SAR ADC, internal clock and other analog and digital peripherals to build complete embedded solutions.

# SAR ADC
Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADCs are great for low-power SoCs.
